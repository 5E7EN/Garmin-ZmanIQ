- `Gregorian.info` comverts the given `Moment` object into local time
- `Gregorian.utcInfo` comverts the given `Moment` object into UTC time
- Inform user that they must be in the same timezone as their assumed location to avoid miscalculations.
  - This can be particularly important when using "Last Activity" location pref
